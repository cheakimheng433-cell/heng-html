            <h2>About Korean Shop</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Korean Shop - your trusted source for authentic Korean products since 2019! We're passionate about bringing the best of Korean culture to customers around the world through carefully curated beauty, fashion, food, and lifestyle products.</p>

            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Korean Shop was founded by a group of Korean culture enthusiasts who fell in love with K-beauty, K-fashion, and Korean cuisine while studying abroad in Seoul. After returning home, we realized how difficult it was to find authentic Korean products outside of Korea. That's when we decided to create Korean Shop - a one-stop destination for all things Korean.</p>
            
            <p>What started as a small online store has grown into a thriving business serving thousands of happy customers worldwide. We work directly with manufacturers and distributors in South Korea to ensure every product we sell is 100% authentic and of the highest quality.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
